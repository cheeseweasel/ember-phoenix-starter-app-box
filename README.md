# Ember Phoenix Starter App Box

This will be a starter app using Ember & Phoenix

I intend to add authentication to the app, but no real functionality beyond that.

We have two repositories

https://github.com/cheeseweasel/ember-phoenix-starter-app-box - uses Vagrant and Puppet to build and configure the server

https://github.com/cheeseweasel/ember-phoenix-starter-app - the actual application

```vagrant up``` to set up the web server

Browse to ```http://localhost:3000/``` to view the application.
